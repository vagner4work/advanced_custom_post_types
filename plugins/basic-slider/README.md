ACPT Basic Slider: 1.0
===

This is a basic slider plugin for ACPT. It automatically creates a slide post type for you with the needed fields. However, it will not add the need jQuery/JS, CSS or HTML for a slider to appear in your theme.

However, "Basic Slider" has a templating function 'list_slides()'. Lets look at the code example to use in your theme files.

```php
<?php list_slides(); ?>
```

This basic function will spit out an unordered list of slides. If a slide has its headline and description enabled it will put them in a div next to the image within an li and add the class 'caption' to it.

```html
<ul class="slides">
  <li><img alt="Slide title" src="img.png" height="350" width="940"></li>
  <li><img alt="Slide title" src="img.png" height="350" width="940"></li>
  <li>
    <img alt="Slide title" src="img.png" height="350" width="940">
    <div class="caption">
      <h2>Headline</h2>
      <p>Description</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Once the HTML is in your theme you can add the jQuery and CSS to style the list as a slider. If the HTML is not to your liking you do have a few options.

Advanced
==

In the 'list_slides()' function you have the ability to select a group to list (See UI 'Group' taxonomy), modify the standard post query, and edit basic HTML. Lets take a look:

```php
<?php
// setup
$group = 'feature';
$args = array('numberposts' => 2);
$settings = array('width' => 300, 'height' => 300);

// list slides
list_slides($group, $args, $settings);
?>
```

This example would list the slides in the group 'feature' only, limit the number of slides to 2 by editing the default args (you can not change the 'post_type'), and sets each image to a new height and width.

Settings
==

Here is a list of all the settings options:

```php
$settings = array(
  'width' => '940',
  'height' => '350',
  'alt' => true,
  'caption_classes' => 'caption',
  'classes' => 'slides');
```

- width: sets images width attr
- height: sets images height attr
- alt: defines if the alt attr should be used (slide title is always the alt)
- caption_classes: sets the caption html classes
- classes: sets the ul elements classess
